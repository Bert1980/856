I'm working on a method to convert upload and convert and output a csv file into an x12 edi formatted txt file with php. Previously I worked on a version that works in autohotkey. Effectively I plan to duplicate the elements from .AHK and port them into PHP.


In the file depository:
856 conversion map.vsdx              \\Flow map showing overall process flow
856 in ahk sample.ahk                \\Previous code in AHK
856.html                             \\Page that holds the upload form
856parse.php                         \\PHP code which converts the uploaded .csv file to x12 856 format
